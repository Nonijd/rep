# My Second Project

In this project I am going to make people to understand the diffrence between 'strings' and 'functions' and their relationship.
In Javascript we can't do without writing strings. Once a variable is declared it comes with a strings. 
They are useful operations we can do on strings with built-in methods, such as finding the length of a text string, joining and splitting strings, substituting one character in a string for another, and more.
